¿PullUP & PullDOWN internos en en ESP32?

The pull value of some pins can be set to Pin.PULL_HOLD to reduce power consumption during deepsleep.

There’s a higher-level abstraction machine.Signal which can be used to invert a pin. Useful for illuminating active-low LEDs using on() or value(1).

Pins 1 and 3 are REPL UART TX and RX respectively

Pins 6, 7, 8, 11, 16, and 17 are used for connecting the embedded flash, and are not recommended for other uses

Pins 34-39 are input only, and also do not have internal pull-up resistors

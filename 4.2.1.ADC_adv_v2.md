ADC.read_uv()Â¶
This method uses the known characteristics of the ADC and per-package eFuse values - set during manufacture - to return a calibrated input voltage (before attenuation) in microvolts. The returned value has only millivolt resolution (i.e., will always be a multiple of 1000 microvolts).

The calibration is only valid across the linear range of the ADC. In particular, an input tied to ground will read as a value above 0 microvolts. Within the linear range, however, more accurate and consistent results will be obtained than using read_u16() and scaling the result with a constant.


val = adc.read_uv()   # read an analog value in microvolts
ADC block 2 is also used by WiFi and so attempting to read analog values from block 2 pins when WiFi is active will raise an exception.

The internal ADC reference voltage is typically 1.1V, but varies slightly from package to package. The ADC is less linear close to the reference voltage (particularly at higher attenuations) and has a minimum measurement voltage around 100mV, voltages at or below this will read as 0. To read voltages accurately, it is recommended to use the read_uv() method (see below).

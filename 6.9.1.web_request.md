### HTTP Requests
Once you are connected to network, you can talk to servers and interact with web services. The easiest way is to just do a HTTP request – what your web browser does to get the content of web pages:

```python
import urequests
r = urequests.get("http://duckduckgo.com/?q=micropython&format=json").json()
print(r)
print(r['AbstractText'])
```

You can use that to get information from websites, such as weather forecasts:

```python
import json
import urequests
r = urequests.get("http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Zurich&appid=XXX").json()
print(r["weather"][0]["description"])
print(r["main"]["temp"] - 273.15)
```
It’s also possible to make more advanced requests, adding special headers
